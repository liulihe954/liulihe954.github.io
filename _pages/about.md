Hi, there! My name is Lihe Liu, and I am a postdoctoral computational biologist from [Dr. Sanju Sinha](https://sbpdiscovery.org/our-scientists/sanju-sinha-phd){:target="\_blank"} group at the [Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute](https://sbpdiscovery.org/){:target="\_blank"}. Earlier, I obtained my Ph.D. in Animal Sciences from UW-Madison, working with [Dr. Francisco Pe√±agaricano](https://andysci.wisc.edu/directory/francisco-penagaricano/){:target="\_blank"}. I transitioned from my previous focus in Animal Genomics to Computational Oncology. When I am not in front of a laptop, you will spot me fishing on a pier or a boat near SD :)

<!-- ## My research and interests

I am broadly interested in computational biology & bioinformatics topics. During my Ph.D., the primary focus of my research is evaluation of the effects of prenatal factors on the epigenome and transcriptome of the offspring in animal species. Additionally, I am interested in scientific software development.

 <!-- e.g., full stack web application, R package, python package, etc. -->
