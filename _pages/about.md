Hi, there! My name is Lihe Liu, and I am a postdoctoral researcher at MD Anderson Cancer Center, advised by
[Dr. Lulu Shang](https://gsbs.uth.edu/directory/profile?id=77f8ec14-b306-4863-a7bf-8558a6b140c2){:target="\_blank"} and [Dr. Yinyin Yuan](https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/yinyin_yuan.html){:target="\_blank"}. Earlier, I obtained my Ph.D. in Animal Sciences from UW-Madison, working with [Dr. Francisco Peñagaricano](https://andysci.wisc.edu/directory/francisco-penagaricano/){:target="\_blank"}.

<!-- ## My research and interests

I am broadly interested in computational biology & bioinformatics topics. During my Ph.D., the primary focus of my research is evaluation of the effects of prenatal factors on the epigenome and transcriptome of the offspring in animal species. Additionally, I am interested in scientific software development.

 <!-- e.g., full stack web application, R package, python package, etc. -->
