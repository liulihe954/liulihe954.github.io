Hi, there! My name is Lihe Liu, currently a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Animal & Dairy Sciences](https://andysci.wisc.edu/){:target="_blank"}, UW-Madison, under the supervision of [Dr. Francisco Pe√±agaricano](https://andysci.wisc.edu/directory/francisco-penagaricano/){:target="_blank"}. Earlier, I worked with Francisco from 2018 to 2020 at the University of Florida. Besides my Animal Science program, I also received M.S.(2023) in [Compuater Sciences](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/){:target="_blank"} from UW-Madison. Previously, I received my B.S. in Animal Sciences (2018) from [Huazhong Agricultural University](https://www.hzau.edu.cn/en/HOME.htm){:target="_blank"}. During my undergrad, I spent one year studying at [China Agricultural University](https://en.cau.edu.cn/), [College of Animal Science and Technology](https://cast1.cau.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"} and another one year studying at the [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

## My research and interests
I am broadly interested in computational biology & bioinformatics topics. During my Ph.D., the primary focus of my research is evaluation of the effects of prenatal factors on the epigenome and transcriptome of the offspring in animal species. Additionally, I am interested in scientific software development.
 <!-- e.g., full stack web application, R package, python package, etc. -->
